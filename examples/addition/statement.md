## Statement

Given an array $A$ of length $n$, find the sum of its elements.  

## Input Format

The first line of input contains $t$, the number of test cases. The test cases themselves
are described in the following lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ denoting the length of the
array. The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$
denoting the elements of the array.

## Constraints

$1 \le T \le 10^5$  
$1 \le n \le 10^5$  
The sum of the $n$s in a single file is $\le 5\cdot 10^5$  
$-10^9 \le A_i \le 10^9$  

**Subtask 1**: $n \le 10$  
**Subtask 2**: $n \le 1000$  
**Subtask 3**: No additional constraints  

## Output Format

For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer
for that test case.
